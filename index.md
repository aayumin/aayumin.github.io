# About Me
I'm interested in Deep learning. 
<br/>
I have been doing AI research since 2019. The framework I use the most is 'pytorch'. I mainly studied Deep learning for Computer vision, but I'm also interested in Cross-modal learning to combine image and text. I steadily learn new technology and carry out research and development.
